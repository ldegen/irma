synopsis:
  irma [<option>…] [<config_file>…]

usage: |
  IRMa starts a small HTTP-server that will host a IR REST-API plus any static
  assets you provide.
  It is configured by giving it an arbitrary number of configuration files.
  The settings in these files will be merged; if there are conflicting settings,
  precedence is given to the setting encountered *first*.
  In addition, you can override some settings via command-line optoins.

  - short: e
    long: es-host

    description: The ElasticSearch node to connect to.
  - short: i
