# IRMa - The Information Retreival Middleware (something with a)

[Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ldegen/irma.svg?branch=master "current build status in travis")

IRMa starts a small HTTP-server that will do three things:

- provide a convenient API to clients to search an ElasticSearch Index 
- provide access to static assets
- proxy HTTP requests to third-party servers with the possibility to
  inject client code and stylesheets into HTML documents.


We are still in the process of writing / translating documentation. Please check back later.
